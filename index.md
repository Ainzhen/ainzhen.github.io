### CPSC 120

Lab 12

Lab 12 as a whole was a fun experience. It allowed me to fully understand major concepts of the semester, calling classes, functions and loop statements. The end results being a .gif file that showed bright colors or an image with text. It was a bit challenging however, it was a fun experience!

Lab 7

Lab 7 Part-2 was the Blackjack lab. Although many of my peers dreaded the lab, due to the complexity of it, I was able to get really deep with if statements. Although it can be daunting and the amount of Linting, Formatting and Debugging that needed to be done, in the end it gave a sense of accomplishment and pride. 

Lab 1 

Lab 1, although the easiest, is considered a memorable lab. It was the start of a new journey! Although I do have some background in Python, Java, and HTML, The start of learning a new language was exciting and it made me interested in learning more about C++ had to offer!
